## About  
ARmor (“Augmented Rider-Monitoring system”) is a smart helmet safety system built during Feb–May 2025 at Sambhram Institute of Tech. It includes:  
- **ESP32 microcontroller** with BLE, accelerometer, GPS, and SOS button  
- **Android app** to relay notifications and alerts  
- **Voice and data alerts** to notify sudden impacts, helmet removal, and SOS triggers  
- **Location tracking** and buzzer feedback for emergencies

---

## Features  
- Real-time **helmet status** detection (worn/removed)  
- **Accident detection** via MPU-6050 accelerometer thresholds  
- SOS alerts via hardware button press  
- **Voice notification support** on Android  
- **GPS location broadcast** via BLE for emergency tracking  
- **Buzzer and LED indicators** for immediate alert

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation  

### 1. Clone the Repo  
bash
git clone https://github.com/Kuusuma/ARmor-Smart-Helmet
cd ARmor


### 2. Install & Configure Dependencies  
- Install Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support  
- Add libraries: TinyGPSPlus, TridentTD_LineNotify, Wire, etc.

### 3. Flash ESP32 Firmware  
- Open main.ino in Arduino IDE  
- Set WiFi SSID/PASSWORD and LINE_TOKEN  
- Upload to ESP32

### 4. Build Android App  
- Open the Android Studio project  
- Run on Android device  
- Ensure Bluetooth & GPS are enabled

---

## 📱 Usage  
1. Wear the helmet → ESP32 detects helmet on via pin sensor → sends BLE message  
2. If helmet removed → Android app notifies user  
3. Detect sudden impact → SOS LED/beeper triggers → Android app shows alert and sends GPS (via Firebase)  
4. Press SOS button → Android relays emergency with location
